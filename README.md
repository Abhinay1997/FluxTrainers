# FluxTrainers
A repo for training Flux with different techniques. Empty for now but will add code for them soon. Planning to do long term support for these.

1. Flux DRaFt & DRaFT-LV
   Note: Its in a standalone repo right now, will move it here.
2. Flux DPO
   Note: Pending
3. Flux LoRA
   Note: Pending but the plan is to support speedups and optimizers from heavyball.
4. Flux SingLoRA
   Note: SingLoRA is cheaper to train. Priority
5. Tokenverse
   Note: Entirely new branch of the model to train. Pretty exciting.
